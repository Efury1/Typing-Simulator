# YouTube Typing Simulator Script - README

## Overview

This script, named **Typing Simulator for YouTube**, is designed to simulate typing out code in real-time, providing a visually dynamic and engaging effect for coding-related YouTube videos. The script reads a series of code lines (provided by the user) and then "types" them out on the screen with a realistic typing effect, complete with customizable delays for both characters and lines. This effect can make coding tutorials or walkthroughs more entertaining and engaging for the audience.

## Features

- **Simulate Typing**: Mimics real-time typing of code, complete with pauses between individual characters and entire lines, giving viewers the experience of watching code being actively written.
- **Customizable Timing**: Offers two timing parameters: one for delays between lines and one for delays between characters, allowing for personalized pacing to suit video preferences.
- **Interactive User Input**: Allows the user to input their own code directly into the program for the typing simulation. This is useful for quick demonstrations during live streams or interactive sessions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- The `colorama` library to provide color to the typed text

To install the required library, you can use:

```sh
pip install colorama
```

## Usage

The script is easy to use. It prompts the user to enter the code that they wish to display with the typing effect. Once the user has entered all the lines of the script, typing `END` on a new line will finish the input and begin the typing simulation.

### Running the Script

1. Run the script using Python:

   ```sh
   python typing_simulator.py
   ```

2. You will be prompted to enter your script line-by-line. Type each line of code, and when you are finished, type `END` to begin the typing simulation.

3. Watch as your code is "typed" out with the realistic typing effect.

### Example

When the script is run, it will look something like this:

```
Enter the script you want to simulate (type 'END' on a new line to finish):
print("Hello, world!")
x = 5
for i in range(x):
    print(i)
END
```

The output will then simulate typing these lines, character by character, with green-colored text for better visibility (using `colorama`).

## Customizing the Typing Effect

The **simulate_typing** function provides the typing effect, which is adjustable via the following parameters:

- **line_delay**: The delay between each line of code (in seconds). The default value is `0.5` seconds.
- **char_delay**: The delay between each character (in seconds). The default value is `0.05` seconds.

You can modify these values directly in the function call to adjust the pacing of the typing effect.

## Run Code

Python simulate_typing.py

## Code Structure

- **simulate_typing(code_lines, line_delay=0.5, char_delay=0.05)**: This function accepts a list of code lines and prints each line character-by-character, simulating the typing effect.
- **gather_user_input()**: Prompts the user to enter lines of code, ending the input when `END` is typed.
- **main()**: The main entry point for the script, handling user input and calling the typing simulator.

## Notes

- **Color Effect**: This script uses `colorama` to color the typed characters in green, making it visually more appealing. You can adjust or remove the color settings if preferred.
- **YouTube Focus**: The script is designed for YouTube content creators, specifically those making coding tutorials, to add an extra layer of engagement by simulating real-time coding.
